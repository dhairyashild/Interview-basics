110. How do you implement immutable infrastructure with Terraform? 
Answer: 
Replace resources instead of modifying 
→ Use create_before_destroy lifecycle rule 
→ Store infra definitions in Git.



107. How do you debug failed persistent volume (PV) mounts in Kubernetes? 

Check PVC and PV status: kubectl get pvc, kubectl get pv.
Describe PVC for detailed events: kubectl describe pvc <pvc-name>.
Describe Pod to see mount errors: kubectl describe pod <pod-name>.
Check Pod logs for mount-related errors: kubectl logs <pod-name>.
Verify StorageClass and provisioner setup.
Launch debug pod mounting same PVC (e.g., busybox) and shell into it.
Inspect volume path on node if using hostPath/local volumes.

REMEMBER SARANSH== describe pod for mount path + storage class & provisioner check name correct + volumebind mode




how to change the instance type in an EKS cluster? 
  REMEMBER --- new nodegroup --- old cordon ten drain -- 

we cant do for running k8s node so create new nodegroup with required instance type
Modify the managed node group's configuration to specify the new instance type (via AWS Console, CLI, or IaC).
EKS automatically starts a rolling update – it launches new nodes with the new instance type.
EKS cordons and drains the old nodes, gracefully evicting pods to the new nodes without downtime.
Old instances are terminated after being successfully drained.
Requirement: Pods must have resource requests/limits defined for the scheduler to bin-pack them correctly onto the new nodes.

🚨 Silent DevOps Failure That Didn’t Throw Any Error 🚨

❌ Problem:

* CI pipeline was green ✅
* Deployment was successful ✅
* But the application behaved like old code 🤯

📌 What made it scary?

1. No errors in logs
2. No failed pods
3. No failed pipeline stages

Users still saw outdated behavior

🧠 Root Cause (Uncommon): Docker image was built using the same tag (latest), and Kubernetes reused the cached image on nodes.

🛠 Solution:

 🔁 Stopped using latest
 ✅ Used immutable image tags (commit ID / build number)

image: myapp:build-1042
imagePullPolicy: Always

🚀 Result: Correct version deployed instantly across all nodes.

💡 DevOps Lesson:

If you don’t version your images, Kubernetes will decide your version for you.
🔥 Green pipelines can still lie.

If you want fewer alarms and less coffee:
• Learn how your cluster picks nodes
• Learn CPU and memory requests and limits
• Learn how observability reduces invisible failures
• Learn why your CNI controls half your workload stability
• Learn the difference between scaling apps and scaling infra

𝐀𝐖𝐒 𝐄𝐊𝐒 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐥𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐎𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 — 𝐊𝐮𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐬 𝐉𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐆𝐨𝐭 𝐚 𝐁𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧


Kubernetes has always been great at running pods.
It was never great at understanding intent.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) just changed that.


𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝐛𝐫𝐨𝐤𝐞𝐧?
• Scheduling logic scattered across node groups, taints, scripts
• Humans deciding cost vs availability vs performance
• Platform teams tuning infra instead of enabling teams
• Scaling decisions reactive, not policy-driven
Kubernetes handled mechanics.
Humans handled judgment.


𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐄𝐊𝐒 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐥𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐎𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐚𝐝𝐝𝐬 • A higher-level workload intent model
• Separation of application needs from infrastructure details
• Policy-driven placement across compute types
• Platform-level reasoning instead of YAML-level tuning
You define what matters.
The platform decides how to run it.

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐬 • Before: node-first thinking
• After: workload-first thinking

• Before: manual trade-offs
• After: automated, repeatable decisions

• Before: infra teams as operators
• After: infra teams as platform builders


𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐯𝐞𝐚𝐭 

This favors mature platforms.

If your workloads aren’t clearly classified, orchestration won’t save you.

Intent must be explicit for automation to work.

This isn’t “more Kubernetes”.
It’s Kubernetes finally moving from execution to decision-making.

Do you want your platform to make these trade-offs automatically — or do you still trust humans more?

Terraform State Management – Solving Real Production Issues with Remote Backends
Today’s focus was on Terraform state management, a critical yet often overlooked component in production-grade DevOps environments.

Common Problems Identified:
1) Terraform state files (.tfstate) cannot be pushed to GitHub due to security risks (contains sensitive infrastructure metadata)

2) State conflicts occur when multiple engineers run Terraform simultaneously, leading to corruption or resource drift

Solution Designed & Implemented:
Configured Remote Backend using AWS S3 for centralized, secure Terraform state storage
Implemented State Locking using DynamoDB, preventing concurrent modifications
Ensured safe collaboration, auditability, and consistency across teams
Fully validated the setup through a practical, end-to-end demo

Outcome:
Achieved secure state handling, eliminated race conditions, and aligned Terraform usage with enterprise DevOps best practices.
