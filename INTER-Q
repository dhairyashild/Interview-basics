110. How do you implement immutable infrastructure with Terraform? 
Answer: 
Replace resources instead of modifying 
→ Use create_before_destroy lifecycle rule 
→ Store infra definitions in Git.



107. How do you debug failed persistent volume (PV) mounts in Kubernetes? 

Check PVC and PV status: kubectl get pvc, kubectl get pv.
Describe PVC for detailed events: kubectl describe pvc <pvc-name>.
Describe Pod to see mount errors: kubectl describe pod <pod-name>.
Check Pod logs for mount-related errors: kubectl logs <pod-name>.
Verify StorageClass and provisioner setup.
Launch debug pod mounting same PVC (e.g., busybox) and shell into it.
Inspect volume path on node if using hostPath/local volumes.

REMEMBER SARANSH== describe pod for mount path + storage class & provisioner check name correct + volumebind mode




how to change the instance type in an EKS cluster? 
  REMEMBER --- new nodegroup --- old cordon ten drain -- 

we cant do for running k8s node so create new nodegroup with required instance type
Modify the managed node group's configuration to specify the new instance type (via AWS Console, CLI, or IaC).
EKS automatically starts a rolling update – it launches new nodes with the new instance type.
EKS cordons and drains the old nodes, gracefully evicting pods to the new nodes without downtime.
Old instances are terminated after being successfully drained.
Requirement: Pods must have resource requests/limits defined for the scheduler to bin-pack them correctly onto the new nodes.
