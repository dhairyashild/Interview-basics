Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the DevOps Engineer position at CloudAge Global Services Pvt Ltd. With over 4 years of professional experience, I bring extensive expertise in AWS, Kubernetes (EKS), Docker, Terraform, Shell scripting, Maven, Jenkins, SonarQube, Prometheus, and Grafana, which I have effectively applied to design, deploy, and maintain scalable, reliable cloud infrastructure.

In my current role, I have successfully automated infrastructure provisioning using Terraform and managed AWS cloud services including EC2, S3, EKS, ECR, and Route53 to ensure highly available environments. I built and optimized CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Maven, enabling faster and reliable deployment to Kubernetes clusters orchestrating over 15 microservices with 99.9% uptime. Moreover, I implemented containerization with Docker and leveraged monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to maintain system health and performance proactively. I also spearheaded proof-of-concept projects incorporating Ansible and Argo-CD, enhancing operational efficiency.

My hands-on experience with version control via GitHub pull requests has helped maintain code quality and best practices. I am passionate about driving automation and streamlining infrastructure management to support robust software delivery pipelines.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute my skills and collaborate with your dynamic team to advance CloudAgeâ€™s cloud infrastructure capabilities. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my technical expertise aligns with your needs.

Sincerely,
DHAIRYASHIL DESAI
