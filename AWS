Elastic IP (EIP):
EIP is region-specific.
You can attach it even when the instance is running, so stopping the instance is not required.
Requires Instance ID and Private IP from the instance.
All machines or IPs in one VPC can communicate with each other within that VPC without internet, even if they are on different subnets.

VPC:
VPC is a private space within a cloud computing platform where you can securely run your applications and store data while having full control over the network and access permissions.
Maximum 5 VPCs per region.
Maximum 5 Elastic IPs per region.
Once a VPC is created, you cannot change its CIDR block.
Subnets within a VPC cannot overlap.

Subnet:
Short for "subnetwork," it is a smaller logical division of an IP network.
Enhances network security by isolating different parts of a network, limiting the scope of potential security breaches, and providing better control over network access.
Public subnet's traffic is routed to an Internet Gateway (IGW) via IP tables.
Private subnet uses NAT for internet access (no IGW).
Allowed block sizes are between /16 to /28.

Reserved Subnet IPs:
First four and last IP addresses of a subnet cannot be assigned:
10.0.0.0: Network address.
10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.
10.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS as the IP address of the DNS server.
10.0.0.3: Reserved for future use.
10.0.0.255: Broadcast address.
