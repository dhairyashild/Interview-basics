Cloud DNS routing patterns ðŸ‘‡                                                                                 ## SIMPLE+ WEIGHTED + FAILOVER +GEOLOCATION + GEOPROXEMITY + LATENCYBASED

Each pattern enables distinct traffic routing methods.

1. Simple:
Route 100% of the traffic to a single resource

2. Weighted:
Specify the % of requests for a specific resource

Fun fact: If all resources have weight=0, traffic is evenly distributed

3. Failover:
- Used for DR purposes, active-passive setup with resource health checks
- On primary health check failure, requests auto-routed to secondary

4. Latency Based:
Redirect users to low-latency resource regions

Fun fact: Not always closest region to the user

5. Geolocation:
- Route traffic by user location
- Matched users routed to pre-configured locations; default location redirects no-match locations

Use case: OTT platforms use this to restrict programs based on the user location

6. Geoproximity:
- Shifts traffic based on a bias.
- To allow more traffic (bias range: 1 to 99)
- To shrink traffic (bias range: -1 to -99)

## ROUTE 53
domain
human readable address used to access website or service on the internet it consist of  name and top level domain extension (like .com ,.org)

dns :â€”â€”> 
act as the internet translator , converting human readable websites names into ip.

route53
Amazon Route 53 is a DNS service by AWS that routes internet traffic to resources based on domain names.

Amazon rote 53:â€”â€”> 
- Amazon Route53 to register new domains, transfer existing domains,
-route traffic request to ur serversâ€”â€” > a record ,cname record
-Check the health of your resources. 



When you register a domain with Route 53:â€”->
-  creates a hosted zone that has the same name as your domain.
- assign a set of four name servers to the hosted zone unique to the account
- name servers inform the browser where to find your resources to web server or s3 bucket

AWS supports:
1. Generic top level domains         â€”â€”>   .com , .net
2. Geographic top level domain    â€”â€”>   .in for india , .cn for china 

Registering a domain with Route 53:
-  register a domain with Route 53 if the TLD is included in list of aws

 NOTE:
 Each Amazon Route 53 account is limited to a maximum of 500 hosted zones and
10,000 resource record sets per hosted zone.

Steps to Configure Route 53:
- register a domain, this can be Route 53 or another DNS registrar 
- Create hosted zone on Route 53 â€”-> automatically if using route 53

delegating to route 53

- Update your domain registrar with the correct name servers for your Route 53 hosted
zone.
-  when u migrate from  1 dns to another â€”-> 24 hours


Route 53 Hosted Zone:
- collection of records for a specific domain.
- records â€”-> how you want traffic to be routed
- for each public â€”â€”> ns record(same name as hosted zone) â€”-> authoratative ns  , SOA record
- four name servers(delegation set)  ,Do not add, change ns

Route 53 as your Authoritative DNS:

- update ns to domain registrar â€”â€”> Route 53 will be responsible to respond to DNS
queries for the hosted zone.

- can create more than one hosted zone with the same name and add different records

- Route 53 assigns four name servers to every hosted zone.different from each other.

- Route 53 never returns values for records in other hosted zones that have the same
name.

***If you are currently using another DNS service and you want to migrate to Amazon Route
53:
- creating a hosted zone. , Update your registrarâ€™s 

***********Transferring a domain between accounts within AWS:
by contacting aws support center

*********Migrating a hosted zone to a different AWS account:



Supported DNS record types by Route 53:

- A record:  Address record- maps domain name to IP

- AAAA record- IPv6 address record: maps domain name to an IPv6 address

A/AAAA are called host records

- CNAME Record: Canonical Name Record - maps an alias domain name to another canonical (primary) domain name

- NS record- name server record used for delegating zone to a name server.

-  SOA record- start of authority record.

- MX record- mail exchange: defines where to deliver mail for user@



Start of Authoritative (SOA) Record:
- Every single zone â€”â€”> only one SOA
- not an actual record, but includes owner, authoritative server , serial number (incremental with changes to the zone data ) , TTL


CNAME Record Type:
- canâ€™t create a CNAME record for the root domain (or zone apex) cant for cns.com
- can create CNAME records for www.cns.com
-  it you create a CNAME record for a subdomain, you cannot create any other
   records for that subdomain.


AWS Route 53 Routing Policies:

1.  Simple Routing (default)
2.  Failover Routing
3.  Geo Location Routing
4.  Multi Value Routing
5.  Latency based Routing
6.  Weighted Routing
7.  Geo-Proximity

Weighted Based Policy:
-  purposes â€” load balancing and testing new versions of software. from 1 to 255. not as percentage


Failover Routing:
-  resource is not healthy - route traffic to a different resource.
-  can route traffic to S3 bucket to a complex tree of records
-  for public hosted zone only


Geo Location Routing:
-  based on the geographic location of the user
-  benefits -> your website in the language of your userâ€™s.


Latency Based Routing::â€”->
-  serving request from ec2 region lowest latency.
-  can create a latency based record for each load balancer.
